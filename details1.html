	  <h2><a href="#">How to Get Smooth Skin 

        <br/>
        Transform Your Textured Skin into Smooth Skin
      </a></h2>
	  <p style="font-size: 22px;">If the constant emergence of cult products and skin care trends are any indication, it’s that the quest for smoother, radiant and younger-looking skin is a never-ending one. From dealing with acne in your teens to stress-related breakouts, sun damage and the first signs of aging in adulthood, you always find yourself fighting the good fight to maintain a healthy-looking visage. While being diligent with your regimen definitely helps keep your skin’s smoothness from going south, there are plenty of other factors that can make or break your skin care goals. Especially when you consider the fact that your skin takes a beating from a number of everyday stressors.</p>
		<h1>What Causes Skin to Become Rough or Textured </h1>
		<p style="font-size: 22px;">Your skin’s health is influenced by several factors—including pollution, stress and sun damage—that, over time, chip away at your complexion and make it more prone to roughness, wrinkles, age spots and sagging. Those who struggle with genetic conditions like eczema, ichthyosis, keratosis pilaris and psoriasis are especially susceptible to having dry and rough skin, as well as those who live in dry climates with low humidity, says Dr. Lillian Soohoo, a board-certified dermatologist in Mountain View, Calif.

            With older women, the chemical and hormonal changes the body undergoes due to perimenopause and menopause can contribute to an overall loss of skin smoothness. In fact, the normal aging process plays a huge role in your skin’s health, says David Pollock, a beauty chemist and skin care expert. “[As we age], our body produces less and less of the key elements that keep us looking younger. Collagen protein provides firmness and support. Yet, by the time a woman reaches menopause, she has about 45 percent less collagen,” Pollock explains.
            
            The buildup of dead and keratinized skin cells and repetitive irritation also take a toll on your skin’s texture and appearance, says Dr. Anna Guanche, a board-certified dermatologist in Los Angeles. Dr. Guanche also cites lack of moisture and hydration as one of the top reasons your skin appears rough and dry.
            
            Doctor Soohoo echoes this and adds, “The uppermost layer of the skin is the stratum corneum, which contains dead skin cells embedded in a waxy matrix of ceramides, cholesterol and fatty acids. These important substances are all types of fats (lipids) that help keep the skin moist and maintain an effective barrier.”</p>
			<h1>How to Improve Skin Texture</h1>
			<p style="font-size: 22px;">Although it may not always be possible for adults to reclaim the firm and blemish-free complexion of their youth, that doesn’t mean you’ll have to give up on your pursuit to age gracefully. Below, we put together a list of dermatologist-recommended tips for smoother skin from head to toe.</p>
				<h1>1. Improve your diet to get better skin.</h1>
				<p style="font-size: 22px;">You know junk food is not good for you, but if you need more reasons to go easy on those tasty snacks, here’s a good one: Processed foods, alcohol and refined carbs contribute to the destruction of good bacteria and create an imbalance in your gut’s microbiome, leading to inflammation that can also manifest in your skin.

                    Instead, add more vitamins and antioxidants in your diet, in the form of berries and other bright-colored fruits and vegetables, to boost your skin’s defenses against free radical damage. Fish is also a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for smooth, radiant skin.
                    
                    “Vitamins A and C and zinc all play an integral role in skin repair and health,” adds Dr. Heidi Prather, M.D., F.A.A.D., a board-certified dermatologist in Austin, Texas. Most fruits and vegetables contain the first two, while zinc can be found in dairy and poultry products, legumes, meat and—best of all—dark chocolate!
				</p>
					<h1>2. Make sure you’re getting enough sleep.</h1><p style="font-size: 22px;">Stress can wreak havoc on your skin, especially when you’re not allowing your body to rest and recover from the daily grind. “Your body repairs itself and recovers from daily stress while you sleep, so not getting enough quality sleep can cause premature aging of the skin,” says Dr. Prather.

                        Doctor Guanche adds, “Those with exhaustion often appear with skin that is sunken in, dry or sallow. On the other hand, those who are rested often have less scalloping under the eyes and in their tear troughs and have plump, fresh-appearing skin.” Needless to say, it’s time you make beauty sleep a priority. Clock in seven to eight hours of quality sleep every night to rejuvenate your skin and your body.</p>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<h1>3. Sweat it out with regular exercise.</h1>
					<p style="font-size: 26px;">
						So you’re already eating more veggies and sleeping better, but your journey to a healthier lifestyle and smoother skin won’t be complete without adding regular exercise to your routine. “Exercise induces more blood volume to be pumped through the vessels of the face, leading to more micronutrients and healing properties to the facial skin,” says Dr. Guanche. It also helps reduce inflammation, regulate skin-significant hormones and prevent free radical damage. Plus, sweating is also a great way to purge pores of debris!</p>
